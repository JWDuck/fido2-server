## Running the example
`node example/test-server.js`
then open your browser to `http://localhost:8088`

First create an account -- type your username, then click "FIDO Register". (This is the equivalent to creating a new account on Facebook, Gmail or any other site). Then login to your new account by typing your username and clicking "FIDO Login". Note that there was never a password in this entire process. Rejoice at never having your password stolen again.

Note: this example currently assumes running on a computer that supports [Microsoft Hello](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/04/12/a-world-without-passwords-windows-hello-in-microsoft-edge/).
